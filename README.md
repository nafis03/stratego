# stratego
Stratego game in c++

This is a remaster of the classic strategy board game "Stratego". The game plays just like the original: two players take turns moving their pieces to try and capture each other's flag.
Each piece can move, capture another if it is of higher rank, and be captured. Each piece has a name, rank and spot on the board. Each game has a single board made up of 100 board spots.
